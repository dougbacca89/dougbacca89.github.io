/*
 * STRING MANIPULATION:
 *
 * We can manipulate strings with operators and methods.
 */

// 1. With Operators //
var a = "Two strings" + " become one.";
/*
 * string manipulation with operators include comparison operators but mainly the addition
 * operator which also stands for the concatination operator which returns two string values
 * together as one. In the example above a would equal a single string of "Two strings become
 * one."
 */

// 2. With String Methods //
/*
 * String methods are built in javascript methods that can be usefule and straight forward
 * ways to manipulate strings to do wat we want. As we se below we have toUpperCase and
 * toLowerCase that manipulate our strings to upper and lower case respectively.
 */
//String Method Examples
/*
 * .toUpperCase();
 * .toLowerCase();
