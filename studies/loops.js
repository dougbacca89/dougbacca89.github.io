/*
 * LOOPS:
 *
 * Loops allow us to loop through collections of data or count for us so we can cut our work
 * down so we dont repeat ourselves to dramaticaly cut the length of outr code down.

// 1. While, For, For-In Loops //
// For Loops
/*
 * For Loops are very useful for looping through arrays. For loops are made three statements
 * separated by semicolons and all within the same parentheses. The first statement is the
 * starting point, the second statement is the stoping point, and the third statement is the
 * loop moves from the starting point to the stopping point.
 */
// For Loop Syntax
/*
 * for (startingPoint; stoppingPoint; howLoopIsMovingFromStartToStop) {
 *          run code using loop
 * }
 */
// For-In Loops
/*
 * For in loops are used to loop through objects. The loop is made with a var key and what
 * what ever object that is needed to be looped through.
 */
// For-In Loop Syntax
/*
 * for (var key in objectToLoopThrough) {
 *          run code using loop
 * }
 */
// While Loops
/*
 * While loops are basic loops that state a condition and keep running the designated code
 * after ther condition until the condition is false.
 */
// While Loop Syntax
/*
 * while (valueToUse < valueToCompareAgainst) {
 *          codeToRunWhileTrue;
 *          aWayToKeepLoopMovingSoYouBreakTheLoop;
 * }
 */
 
// 2. Counting Forwards or Backwards to Some Limit //
/*
 * You can start and end your loops how ever you need to whether your starting point is higher
 * or lower than your stopping point just be sure to always move your loop in the right
 * direction towards the stopping point.
 */

// 3. Looping Forwards and Backwards over Arrays //
/*
 * When looping through arrays be sure to keep in mind if you start at the begining keep .length
 * in mind for your stopping point and if you start at the end you can always use the 0 index
 * as a stopping point.
 */

// 4. Looping over Objects //
/*
 * When looping over objects with ForIn loops they stop themselves but you must keep in mind
 * the proper dot notation or bracket notation to get the intended results of you code.
